Shell scripts for automated macOS machine setup.

This project is a framework for automating the setup of a macOS machine. In order to illustrate the
potential of what this project can do, please see the companion
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS Config] project for details. The _macOS
Config_ project is an opinionated configuration which meets the needs of my development environment
but is also meant to serve as an example and guide for building your own personalized setup. Here is
how the two projects are meant to be used:

* *macOS* (this project) - The foundational framework for building custom macOS machine setups.
* *link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS Configuration]* - The layer on top of
  this _macOS_ project which defines a custom machine implementation. The project is meant to be
  forked for as many custom machine setups as needed.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur[macOS Big Sur]
. link:https://developer.apple.com/xcode[Xcode]

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os.git
cd mac_os
git checkout 13.0.0
----

== Usage

Run the following:

[source,bash]
----
bin/run
----

You will be presented with the following options (listed in order of
use):

....
Boot:
   B:  Create boot disk.
Install:
   b:  Apply basic settings.
   t:  Install development tools.
  hf:  Install Homebrew Formulas.
  hc:  Install Homebrew Casks.
   m:  Install Mac App Store software.
   a:  Install application software.
   x:  Install application software extensions.
  df:  Install dotfiles.
  np:  Install Node packages.
  rg:  Install Ruby gems.
  rc:  Install Rust crates.
   d:  Apply default settings.
  cs:  Configure installed software.
   i:  Install everything (i.e. executes all install options in order listed).
Restore:
   R:  Restore settings from backup.
Manage:
   c:  Check status of managed software.
   C:  Caffeinate machine.
  ua:  Uninstall application software.
  ux:  Uninstall application software extension.
  ra:  Reinstall application software.
  rx:  Reinstall application software extension.
   w:  Clean work (temp) directory.
   q:  Quit/Exit.
....

Choose option `i` to run a full install or select a specific option to run a single action. Each
option is designed to be re-run if necessary. This can also be handy for performing upgrades,
re-running a missing/failed install, etc.

The option prompt can be skipped by passing the desired option directly to the `bin/run` script. For
example, executing `bin/run i` will execute the full install process.

The machine should be rebooted after all install tasks have completed to ensure all settings have
been loaded.

It is recommended that the `mac_os` project directory not be deleted and kept on the local machine
in order to manage installed software and benefit from future upgrades.

=== Boot Disk

When attempting to create a boot disk via `bin/run B`, you’ll be presented with the following
documentation (provided here for reference):

....
macOS Boot Disk Tips
  - Use a USB drive (8GB or higher).
  - Use Disk Utility to format the USB drive as "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)".
  - Use Disk Utility to label the USB drive as "Untitled".

macOS Boot Disk Usage:
  1. Insert the USB boot disk into the machine to be upgraded.
  2. Reboot the machine.
  3. Hold the POWER (Silicon) or OPTION (Intel) key before the Apple logo appears.
  4. Select the USB boot disk from the menu.
  5. Use Disk Utility to delete and/or erase the hard drive including associated partitions.
  6. Use Disk Utility to create a single "APFS" drive as a "GUID Partition Table".
  7. Install the new operating system.

macOS Boot Disk Recovery:
  1. Start/restart the machine.
  2. Hold the POWER (Silicon) or COMMAND+R (Intel) keys before the Apple logo appears.
  3. Wait for the macOS installer to load from the recovery partition.
  4. Use the dialog options to launch Disk Utility, reinstall the system, etc.
....

=== Customization

All executable scripts can be found in the `bin` folder:

* `bin/apply_basic_settings` (optional, customizable): Applies basic and initial settings for
  setting up a machine.
* `bin/apply_default_settings` (optional, customizable): Applies bare minimum system and application
  defaults.
* `bin/configure_software` (optional, customizable): Configures installed software as part of the
  post install process.
* `bin/create_boot_disk` (optional): Creates a macOS boot disk.
* `bin/install_app_store` (optional, customizable): Installs macOS, GUI-based, App Store
  applications.
* `bin/install_applications` (optional, customizable): Installs macOS, GUI-based, non-App Store
  applications.
* `bin/install_dev_tools` (required): Installs macOS development tools required by Homebrew.
* `bin/install_dotfiles` (optional, customizable): Installs personal dotfiles so the system is
  tailored to your workflow.
* `bin/install_extensions` (optional, customizable): Installs macOS application extensions and
  add-ons.
* `bin/install_homebrew_casks` (optional, customizable): Installs Homebrew Formulas.
* `bin/install_homebrew_formulas` (optional, customizable): Installs Homebrew Casks.
* `bin/install_node_packages` (optional, customizable): Installs Node packages.
* `bin/install_ruby_gems` (optional, customizable): Installs Ruby gems.
* `bin/install_rust_crates` (optional, customizable): Installs Rust crates.
* `bin/restore_backup` (optional, customizable): Restores system/application settings from backup
  image.
* `bin/run` (required): The main script and interface for macOS setup.

The `lib` folder provides the base framework for installing, re-installing, and uninstalling
software. Everything provided via the link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS
Config] project is built upon the functions found in the `lib` folder. See the
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/mac_os-config[macOS Config] project for further details.

* `lib/settings.sh`: Defines global settings for software applications, extensions, etc.

== Troubleshooting

* When using link:https://pi-hole.net[Pi-hole], you might need to temporarily disable prior to
  upgrading as you might experience various errors with Apple not being able to detect an internet
  connection which prevents the installer from working.
* When using the boot disk and the installer fails in some catestrophic manner, reboot the machine
  into recovery mode -- `POWER` (Silicon) or `COMMAND + R` (Intel) buttons -- to download and
  install the last operating system used. Alternatively, you can also use `COMMAND + OPTION + R`
  (Intel) to attemp to download the latest operating system.
* When using the boot disk, you might experience a situation where you see a black screen with a
  white circle and diagonal line running through it. This means macOS lost or can’t find the boot
  disk for some reason. To correct this, shut down and boot up the system again while holding down
  the `OPTION + COMMAND + R + P` (Intel) keys simultaneously. You might want to wait for the system
  boot sound to happen a few times before releasing the keys. This will clear the system NVRAM/PRAM.
  At this point you can shut down and restart the system following the boot disk instructions (the
  boot disk will be recognized now).
